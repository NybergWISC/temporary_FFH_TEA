# temporary_FFH_TEA

Some scripts related to the ACCERT and TEAm economics analysis. All scripts here are WIP

- ACCERT_scripts: scripts directly editing templates and running sweeps semi-automatically
- ACCERT_formatting_TEAm: some scripts to make an early version of an ACCERT-style xlsx or csv from a code automatically. Currently attempting with a mirror-based code
