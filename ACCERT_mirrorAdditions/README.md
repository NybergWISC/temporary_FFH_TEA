# Getting Started

The main function of ACCERT (The Algorithm for the Capital Cost Estimation of Reactor Technologies) is to provide an item-by-item estimate of the cost of a facility, at present a nuclear reactor complex, primarily nuclear power stations. The core of ACCERT is the large number of algorithms that have been developed and will continue to be developed. ACCERT is also a general methodology for identifying and organizing the individual items that are estimated using the ACCERT algorithms. ACCERT also summarize status and results; to save results and pull information from previous analyses; and to provide an interactive dynamic graphical user interface for a wide range of functions and visualizations. 


The software comprises three major components:
*	Relational Database
    *	Creation, editing, and linking of different element types
    *	Report generation (queries)
    *	Search
*	Equation solvers (extraction of information from elements and evaluation/updating of fields in the database)
    *	Algorithms
    *	Escalation
    *	Cost aggregation
*	Interactive Graphical User Interface
    *	Dynamic windows


ACCERT is designed for integration with the [NEAMS
Workbench](https://www.ornl.gov/project/neams-workbench) and relies on input
files using Workbench's SON format. Instructions for installing ACCERT both
with and without Workbench are provided in this README.
